# The App package

This package sets up a [React](https://react.dev/) web app and uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to manage the bundling and serving of web assets.
The React app uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for Single Page Application routing.

For development you can run the command `npm run dev` which uses `vite` to watch files so the web app updates each time you save a change.  
You can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running.

To prepare your application for deployment you can run `npm run build`.  
To preview your web app you can use `npx vite preview --port 3000`.

## Environment variables

You can set environment variables in the `.env` file or in the Render.com environment variables section.

## JSX

Vite has built in support for [JSX](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_jsx.asp). Any file that contains JSX code should have the `.jsx` file extension.

## CSS

Vite has built in support for CSS imports, simply create a `.css` file and import it:

```
import "./main.css";
```

## Assets

Any asset linked in `index.html` should be placed in the `public` folder.  
For assets that are used by React components, they should be placed in the `assets` folder.  
You can import them into your files like this:

```
import hyfLogo from "../../assets/hyf.svg";
```

## Calling the API using `fetch` and the `api()` helper

When you need data from the API, you can use `fetch` but it's important to not hardcode the URLs since they will differ between your development environment and the deployment environment. For this we can use the `api()` helper function.

Assuming you've deployed your API somewhere and you've defined the following environment variable:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://my-cool-domain:1234

```

When you call `api('/nested')` the helper generates the following URL `https://my-cool-domain:1234/api/nested` which you can pass to `fetch`:

```
const response = await fetch(api('/nested'));
```

## Deploying a static web app

> Last tested: 2024-04-11

Follow the steps [here](../api/README.md#deploying) first to deploy your database and your web service.

Once you've done that, click "New" and this time select "Static Site".

Select the same repository as you used for the web service.

Fill in the required fields and add the "VITE_API_URL" environment variable with the value based on the URL your web service got (for example `https://hyf-template-api.onrender.com/api`). Then click "Create Static Site".

In the next screen, wait until you see the text "Your site is live".  
Then navigate to "Redirects/Rewrites".

Click "Add Rule" and input the below rule settings before clicking "Save Changes".

![](../images/render/app/step23.png)

After this you should be able to test your web app on the URL shown, which should be something like `https://hyf-template-app.onrender.com/`.

If everything has been done correctly then your web app should be able to load data from your web service's API.
